Homework assignment

1. Open a pull request to let me know that youâ€™ve finished this course (You can just edit this page and commit to a pull request).

I updated the README file and submitted a pull request.

2. Create a new markdown or text file in this repository. Let me know what you learned and what you are still confused about.

I learned more about terms like branches and pull request which I have heard of, but I did not previously know much about. I still find the Github site a bit confusing
to navigate, but I will probably get used to it as I use it more.

3. Describe one of the ways that Wilson et. al. suggest is a good practice for computational reproducibility and how a tool like R and/or GitHub can be used.

Wilson et al. mentions keeping track of changes as a good practice for computational reproducibility. This can be easily done using Github. Whenever you make changes to
your code in R, you can track those changes in Github by submitting a pull request. This allows for better reproducibility of your data because others can see changes 
made to the code and they can go back and look at older versions if something does not seem right.

4. Save the file, commit the changes, and push the homework to the GitHub repository for the homework.

Done:)
